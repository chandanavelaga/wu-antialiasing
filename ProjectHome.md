Wu anti-aliasing is a technique for generating smooth graphics lines. It is an algorithm that computes pixel colors in such a manner that the jagged-ness of raster graphics lines is eliminated.

Current code is built in MFC (but is platform agnostic). It can be easily ported to other platforms.

At the moment FLTK uses this code. http://www.fltk.org/

Originally developed by Suchit Tiwari and published online for people around the world to use it. This is based Zen of Computer Graphics by Michael Abrash.
